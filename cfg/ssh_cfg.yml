ForwardX11 yes
ForwardX11Trusted yes

# ubuntu 默认采用 用起来最爽但也最危险的设置

# 有点confusing:
# https://askubuntu.com/a/35518/1169461
#
# 理论上:
# 1.
# ssh -Y remotemachine  ( enable trusted X11 forwarding )
# the remote machine is treated as a trusted client.
# can open security problems.
# 
# 2.
# ssh -X remotemachine  (enable untrusted X11 forwarding)
# the remote machine is treated as an untrusted client, 所以会有安全机制, 就相对安全.
# untrusted does not mean that machine is more dangerous than trusted machine, 
# but means you are cautious
#
# 实际上:
# Debian(ubuntu也是)-specific:
# In the default configuration:
#                             ForwardX11Trusted yes
#                             不设防, 会覆盖 ForwardX11 的设置
#  -X is equivalent to  -Y 
#  Set the ForwardX11Trusted option to “no” to restore the upstream behaviour.
#
#
# ForwardX11 yes
#    # 默认是no.  用起来有安全风险, 要注意 (怎么注意?)
#    
#  # ssh -x  | disable X11 forwarding
#
# man里, 这个和-X对应, 而非-Y:
#                  ForwardX11Trusted yes
#    # Debian-specific:
#     # 默认是yes
#    #  less secure because, it removes X11 SECURITY extension controls/restrictions.
#    #  because too many programs currently crash in this mode (有restrictions时)
#                  ( because -X drops the forwarding after a timeout ? )
#    # Set the ForwardX11Trusted option to “no” to restore the upstream behaviour.
#
#    You can override that config using ForwardX11Timeout for the -X option, though
#    -Y doesn't.
#
#    only find:
#    #   ConnectTimeout 0
